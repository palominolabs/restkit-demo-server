== README

This repo contains a quick and dirty Rails server that is designed to support the iOS application in the restkit-demo project.  It has been tested and used, but is mostly throwaway code that just provides an endpoint for the iOS client to demonstrate a few features in RestKit.

If you have problems installing or running this, feel free to contact ace@palominolabs.com, but there is no guarantee as to responsive support.
